# 5 minute fork

Heard of 10 minute email? Well this is the same thing, except for github repos.

The number of times I've come across a cool demo, only to be faced with a github repo and no live link - it just bums me out. 

So I made this (quickly - literally about 90 minutes), which reads the url, and forks the project. If the url is idle for 5 minutes, then it's automatically swept under the carpet.

The code is pretty gnarly, but don't judge me - I wanted quick and dirty.

## How to fork for 5 minutes

Simply take a public github url and swap out the https://github.com for [http://5minfork.com](http://5minfork.com), wait a moment for the project to be cloned, and then you'll be redirected to a unique url which will serve up static content from the project.
